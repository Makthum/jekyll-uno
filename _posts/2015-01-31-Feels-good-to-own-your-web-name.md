It is always exciting to find your name ,blog or some relevant information of yours showing up on google search when you google your name. Isn't it?. Thats one of the reason i bought the domain name on my name. Another reason is , always i wanted to blog and when i setup my github blogging using Jekyll. I found github pages also supports custom domain then i thought now is the time to put my name out their in the wild . A webname for myself Yay!!!!

If you guys are planning to having a personal blog or portfolio site then it makes sense to own a website on your name. Fortunately my name is not that common and I was lucky enough to get a website on .com domain on my name.

## Submitting your domain to google to Index

Though blogging with github pages is cool and easy , when i tried to submit my blog to google for indexing it plainly throwed an error at my face. I did some googling and figured out that ur sitemap.xml needs to be on parent domain and not on sub domain like makthum.github.io. So next thing it struck my mind was to buy a domain. I had couple of domains in the past with some crazy website names . This time i came across several articles on the internet and why you should buy your own domain name.

After reading these articles it perfectly made sense and i decided to buy myself a domain name and use it for github blog. Well done boy !!!!  after some fiddling with dns and cname record Now makthum.com works :).

## Dude Al-Maktoum ?????

Man i wanted my name to appear on the google search badly ,when someone typed makthum in search box. I bought myself a domain name and I already submitted my sitemap.xml to google. Now it is time to put your name on the google and find out what google has to offer. 

Come on dude Al-maktoum I know you are quite famous and Prime minister of UAE. Give me some credits for what i deserve. Even if i google my name with correct spelling . Google searchs for Maktoum instead of "Makthum" because of the popularity. I understand google lists its search results based on popularity, but it is disheartening to see your name is auto corrected for someone. I am keeping my finger crossed. Someday when my domain name appears first on search results Google might stop auto-correcting. For now i am content i got myself a website on my name.


Have a good day guys!!
